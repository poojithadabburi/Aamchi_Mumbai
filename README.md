## üåê Mumbai Tourism Website

### Project Overview
I created a static website dedicated to showcasing the vibrant tourism options in Mumbai. 
This project includes dynamic features to enhance user experience, such as interactive maps and fare estimation tools, 
along with a dedicated login and review page for users to share their experiences.

### Features
- **Dynamic Maps:** Integrated interactive maps to help users explore popular tourist spots in Mumbai.
- **Fare Estimation:** Users can estimate travel costs by providing approx distance in km within the city.
- **Login & Review Page:** A secure login system that allows users to submit and view reviews of their experiences.
- **Tourism Information:** Comprehensive information on attractions, cultural sites.

Feel free to explore the repository and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions!
