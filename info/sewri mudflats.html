        <p><b>History</b><br>
            ewri Mudflats have a rich ecological history that reflects the changing landscape of Mumbai and its coastal ecosystems:

<br>Historical Significance: The area has been a vital part of Mumbai’s coastal ecosystem for centuries, serving as a habitat for various bird species and marine life. Historically, it was less developed than other parts of Mumbai, allowing for a more diverse range of flora and fauna.

<br>Industrial Development: In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Mumbai underwent significant industrialization, impacting the coastal areas. The Sewri Mudflats were not immune to these changes, with increasing urbanization and pollution affecting the ecosystem.

<br>Migratory Patterns: Over the years, Sewri has become a noted stopover for migratory birds due to its unique environment. The arrival of lesser flamingos, which began to be recorded in significant numbers from the 1980s onwards, has highlighted the area’s importance as a birdwatching site.

<br>Conservation Awareness: As awareness of environmental issues grew, efforts to protect Sewri Mudflats began in the late 20th century. Local NGOs and environmentalists have worked to raise awareness about the ecological significance of the area, leading to initiatives aimed at conserving its unique habitat.

<br>Recent Developments: In recent years, ongoing urban development has posed challenges to the mudflats, prompting more focused conservation efforts. The site has been included in discussions around urban planning and sustainable development in Mumbai.</p>
